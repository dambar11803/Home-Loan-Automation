# 🏠 Home Loan Automation System

## 📘 Introduction

The **Home Loan Automation System** is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the **home loan file preparation** process. Traditionally, loan officers are required to fill multiple forms such as **CDT1, CDT2, CDT5**, etc., often with repeated information across forms. This results in time-consuming and repetitive tasks.

This system eliminates redundancy by allowing users to input client details once. After the complete entry of client data, the application automatically generates pre-filled official forms, including the **Credit Facility Request (CFR)** form — a crucial document required for home loan approval.
